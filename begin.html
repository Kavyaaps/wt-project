      <h2>What is a stamp collector called?</h2>
      <p>The correct name for a stamp collector is exactly that, a stamp collector. As you begin to find out about stamp collecting, you may see collectors being referred to as "philatelists". While this is not entirely untrue, philately refers to the study of stamps and therefore does not always involve collecting. However, it is not uncommon for the term "philatelist" and "stamp collector" to be used interchangeably.</p>

      <h2>Should I start collecting stamps?</h2>
      <p>Stamp collecting in the modern day is still one of the most popular hobbies in the world, with more than 20 million collectors globally!</p>
      <p>Stamp collecting as a hobby doesn’t need to take up lots of your time or money and there are fantastic communities across the world with whom to share this fun and fascinating passion with. Whether you want a hobby that you can partake in on the occasional weekend or really dive into, stamp collecting could certainly be that for you.</p>
      <p>The fantastic appeal of stamp collecting is you are entirely independent in how fast you acquire your stamps and how far you take your collection. If you have a lot of disposable income, you could certainly build up a high-value stamp collection faster. However, that is neither the goal for many collectors nor is it necessarily the way you are going to best enjoy collecting stamps. With so many variations around the world, your stamp collection can be anything you want it to be!</p>
